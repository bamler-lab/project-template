# Latex Source Code for the Paper on Project XXX

- Place your LaTeX source code here.
- Place figures in the `figures` subdirectory.
- Don't commit the compiled PDF file (or any other compilation artifacts) to git, as this will lead to lots of merge conflicts.
- If you write the paper on overleaf, then add a link to it here or in the top-level `README.md` instead.
